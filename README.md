## How to embed the visualization into the webpage

1. Go to File > Publish to Tableau Public or Tableau Server.
2. Copy the embed URL for each view (youâ€™ll need these URLs later).
3. Paste to [index.html](./webpage/index.html) in the appropriate place.
4. Check https://young1018.github.io/Traffic-in-Atlanta/ to see if the visualization is embedded correctly. (It may take a few minutes to update.)
