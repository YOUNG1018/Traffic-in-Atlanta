## How to embed the visualization into the webpage

1. Go to **Server** > **Tableau Public** > **Save to Tableau Public**.
2. You may be asked to extract the data if the data connections are external. To do this, go to **Data** > hovering on your data > **Extract Data**.
3. Inside the Tableau Public page, go to **Share** > **Copy Embed Code**. Then you have the code to your workbook ready! Yayyy!
4. Copy the embed URL for each view (youâ€™ll need these URLs later).
5. Paste to [index.html](./webpage/index.html) in the appropriate place.
6. Check https://young1018.github.io/Traffic-in-Atlanta/ to see if the visualization is embedded correctly. (It may take a few minutes to update.)
